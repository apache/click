Provides a method to surround other Click controls with a template. Panels 
implement the {@link net.sf.click.extras.panel.Panel} interface to allow proper 
template rendering. Panels are processed by the Page it is associated with.
<p/>
Using panels is similar to using Tiles in Struts, but more programmatic 
(via Java) than from an external configuration file.
