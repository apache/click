<h2><a name="h-1.1">1.1</a> How the specification is organized</h2>

<p>This specification is divided into the following sections:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Sections 2 and 3: Introduction to HTML 4</strong></dt>

<dd>The introduction describes HTML's place in the scheme of the World Wide
Web, provides a brief history of the development of HTML, highlights what can
be done with HTML 4, and provides some HTML authoring tips. 

<p>The brief SGML tutorial gives readers some understanding of HTML's
relationship to SGML and gives summary information on how to read the HTML
Document Type Definition (DTD).</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Sections 4 - 24: HTML 4 reference manual</strong></dt>

<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the HTML language reference,
which defines all elements and attributes of the language. 

<p>This document has been organized by topic rather than by the grammar of
HTML. Topics are grouped into three categories: structure, presentation, and
interactivity. Although it is not easy to divide HTML constructs perfectly into
these three categories, the model reflects the HTML Working Group's experience
that separating a document's structure from its presentation produces more
effective and maintainable documents.</p>

<p>The language reference consists of the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What <a href="charset.html#doc-char-set">characters</a> may appear in an
HTML document.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Basic <a href="types.html">data types</a> of an HTML document.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Elements that govern the structure of an HTML document, including <a href= 
"./struct/text.html">text</a>, <a href="./struct/lists.html">lists</a>, <a
href="./struct/tables.html">tables</a>, <a href="./struct/links.html">
links</a>, and <a href="./struct/objects.html">included objects, images, and
applets</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Elements that govern the presentation of an HTML document, including <a
href="./present/styles.html">style sheets</a>, <a href=
"./present/graphics.html">fonts, colors, rules, and other visual
presentation</a>, and <a href="./present/frames.html">frames for multi-windowed
presentations</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Elements that govern interactivity with an HTML document, including <a href= 
"./interact/forms.html">forms for user input</a> and <a href= 
"./interact/scripts.html">scripts for active documents</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The SGML formal definition of HTML:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="./sgml/sgmldecl.html">SGML declaration of HTML</a>.</li>

<li>Three DTDs: <a href="./sgml/dtd.html">strict</a>, <a href= 
"./sgml/loosedtd.html">transitional</a>, and <a href="./sgml/framesetdtd.html">
frameset</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="./sgml/entities.html">list of character references</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Appendixes</strong></dt>

<dd>The first appendix contains information about <a href=
"appendix/changes.html">changes from HTML 3.2</a> to help authors and
implementors with the transition to HTML 4, and <a href= 
"appendix/changes.html#19980424">changes from the 18 December 1997
specification</a>. The second appendix contains <a href="appendix/notes.html">
performance and implementation notes</a>, and is primarily intended to help
implementors create user agents for HTML 4.</dd>

<dt><strong>References</strong></dt>

<dd>A list of normative and informative references.</dd>

<dt><strong>Indexes</strong></dt>

<dd>Three indexes give readers rapid access to the definition of key <a href= 
"./index/list.html">concepts</a>, <a href="./index/elements.html">elements</a>
and <a href="./index/attributes.html">attributes</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="h-1.2">1.2</a> Document conventions</h2>

<p>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind: authors
and implementors. We hope the specification will provide authors with the tools
they need to write efficient, attractive, and accessible documents, without
over-exposing them to HTML's implementation details. Implementors, however,
should find all they need to build conforming user agents.</p>

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification begins with a
general presentation of HTML and becomes more and more technical and specific
towards the end.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get information
about syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the online version of the
specification includes the following features: 

<ol>
<li>Every reference to an element or attribute is linked to its definition in
the specification. Each element or attribute is defined in only one
location.</li>

<li>Every page includes links to the indexes, so you never are more than two
links away from finding the definition of an <a href="index/elements.html">
element</a> or <a href="index/attributes.html">attribute</a>.</li>

<li>
<p>The front pages of each section of the language reference manual extend the
initial table of contents with more detail about that section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h-1.2.1">1.2.1</a> Elements and attributes</h3>

<p>Element names are written in uppercase letters (e.g., BODY). Attribute names
are written in lowercase letters (e.g., lang, onsubmit). Recall that in HTML,
element and attribute names are case-insensitive; the convention is meant to
encourage readability.</p>

<p>Element and attribute names in this document have been marked up and may be
rendered specially by some user agents.</p>

<p>Each attribute definition specifies the type of its value. If the type
allows a small set of possible values, the definition lists the set of values,
separated by a bar (|).</p>

<p>After the type information, each attribute definition indicates the
case-sensitivity of its values, between square brackets ("[]"). See the section
on <a href="types.html#case">case information</a> for details.</p>

<h3><a name="h-1.2.2">1.2.2</a> Notes and examples</h3>

<p>Informative notes are emphasized to stand out from surrounding text and may
be rendered specially by some user agents.</p>

<p>All examples illustrating <a href="conform.html#deprecated">deprecated</a>
usage are marked as "DEPRECATED EXAMPLE". Deprecated examples also include
recommended alternate solutions. All examples that illustrates illegal usage
are clearly marked "ILLEGAL EXAMPLE".</p>

<p>Examples and notes have been marked up and may be rendered specially by some
user agents.</p>
