<h3>Demo1</h3>

In this first demo is shown how the Form is submitted when the SubmitLink is
clicked. Note that the SubmitLink parameters will be sent as part of the Form
submission.

$form

#if ($demo1Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo1Msg</p>
#end

<h3>Demo2</h3>

This demo shows how the SubmitLink can be used outside a Form. When a SubmitLink
is not inside a Form it behaves like a normal ActionLink.

<p/>

Click <a href="$standaloneLink.href">here</a> to invoke the SubmitLink.

#if ($demo2Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo2Msg</p>
#end


$dForm
