This example demonstrates how to dynamically add fieldsets to a form.
<ul>
    <li>
        The JavaScript function <tt>Click.submit(form, validate)</tt> is set as
        the Select <tt>onchange</tt> handler. Changing the select option will
        submit the form, but bypass form validation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The utility method <tt>ClickUtils.bind(Form)</tt> is used to bind
        and inspect the Select value <tt>before</tt> the page onProcess event.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the selected value is "Property" an address fieldset is added to the form.
        If the selected value is "Stocks" an amount field is added to the form.
    </li>

</ul>
