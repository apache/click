This example demonstrates how to dynamically add fields to a form through a
select control.
<ul>
    <li>
        The form is submitted using the JavaScript statement, <tt>form.submit()</tt>,
        which is set as the Select <tt>onchange</tt> handler. Changing the select
        option will submit the form. On the server, Form
        <tt>validation</tt> is switched off through, <tt>Form.setValidate(false)</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The utility method <tt>ClickUtils.bind(Form)</tt> is used to bind
        and inspect the Select value <tt>before</tt> the page onProcess event.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the selected value is "Property", an address fieldset is added to the form.
        If the selected value is "Stocks", an amount field is added to the form.
    </li>

</ul>
