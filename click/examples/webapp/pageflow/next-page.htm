Demonstration of page flow design patterns. &nbsp; Please confirm course details:

<p/>

<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
 <tr>
  <td><b>Customer Name</b></td>
  <td>$customer.name &nbsp; (Customer No. $customer.id)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Course Type</b></td>
  <td>$courseBooking.courseType</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Booking Date</b></td>
  <td>$format.date($courseBooking.bookingDate, "dd MMM yyyy")</td>
 </tr>
 #if ($courseBooking.bookingNotes != "")
 <tr>
  <td><b>Booking Notes</b></td>
  <td>$courseBooking.bookingNotes</td>
 </tr>
 #end
</table>

$form

<p>&nbsp;</p>

When the booking is confirmed the page will redirect to the last page:
<pre class="codeJava">
Long bookingId = getBookingService().insertCourseBooking(booking);

String path = getContext().getPagePath(LastPage.<span class="kw">class</span>);
setRedirect(path + <span class="st">"?bookingId="</span> + bookingId);
</pre>

This page flow design pattern is known as Post-Redirect.
