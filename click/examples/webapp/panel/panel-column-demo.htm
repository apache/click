<p/>
The source for the PanelColumn can be found <a target="_blank" href="$context/source-viewer.htm?filename=WEB-INF/classes/net/sf/click/examples/page/panel/PanelColumn.java">here</a>.

Search for the name "david" to see panels embedded inside the
Table. Note Table pagination is working as expected.
