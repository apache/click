This demo shows how to add
<a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/click-api/org/apache/click/Page.html#getHeadElements()">HEAD elements</a>
to a Page. In this example the <a class="external" target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
library and the JavaScript snippet, <a href="$context/source-viewer.htm?filename=/general/page-head-demo.js">page-head-demo.js</a>,
are added to the Page's HEAD elements.
<p/>

The <a href="$context/source-viewer.htm?filename=/general/page-head-demo.js">page-head-demo.js</a> script,
uses jQuery to register a 'click' listener on the link to toggle the Field visibility.
