Provides renderable HTML controls. Controls implement the
{@link net.sf.click.Control} interface to perform server side request
processing. At the top level a Pages controls are processed by the
ClickServlet. Some controls can contain child controls which they will inturn
process. These container controls include Form, FieldSet, Panel and Table.
<p/>
Using these controls is similar to traditional Swing GUI programming. While these 
controls do not provide a full Swing style MVC implementation, they provided a
simplified programming model and high performance.
<p/>
Click Controls provide an event callback mechanism similar the 
<tt>java.awt.ActionListener</tt> callback. 

<pre class="codeJava">
<span class="kw">public class</span> MyPage <span class="kw">extends</span> Page {

    <span class="kw">public</span> ActionLink actionLink = <span class="kw">new</span> ActionLink();

    <span class="kw">public</span> MyPage() {
        actionLink.setListener(<span class="kw">this</span>, <span class="st">"onLinkClick"</span>);
    }
    
    <span class="kw">public boolean</span> onLinkClick() {
        System.out.println(<span class="st">"onLinkClick invoked"</span>);
        <span class="kw">return true</span>;
    }
} </pre>

All call back listener methods must return a boolean value. If they return true
the the further processing of other controls and page methods should continue.
Otherwise if they return false, then any further processing should be aborted.
By returning false you can effectively exit at this point and redirect or forward 
to another page.
