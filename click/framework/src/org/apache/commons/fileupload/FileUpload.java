/**
 * <p>High level API for processing file uploads.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class handles multiple files per single HTML widget, sent using
 * <code>multipart/mixed</code> encoding type, as specified by
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">RFC 1867</a>.  Use {@link
 * #parseRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)} to acquire a list of {@link
 * org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem}s associated with a given HTML
 * widget.</p>
 *
 * <p>How the data for individual parts is stored is determined by the factory
 * used to create them; a given part may be in memory, on disk, or somewhere
 * else.</p>
