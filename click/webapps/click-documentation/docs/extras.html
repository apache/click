<h1>Click Extras</h1>
<p/>
Click Extras provide additional controls and components which are outside
of the core Click framework. Click Extras are packaged as a separated JAR which 
you can deploy with your application.

Click Extras provides a place for people to contribute their own code to the
Click project and have it package with the standard distribution.
