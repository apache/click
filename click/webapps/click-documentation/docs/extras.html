<h1>Click Extras</h1>
<p/>
Click Extras provide additional controls and components which are outside
of the core Click framework. Click Extras are packaged as a separated JAR which 
you can deploy with your application.
<p/>
Click Extras provides a place for people to contribute their own code to the
Click project and have it package with the standard distribution. Contributed
code will be subject to review and may require modifications before it is
included in the Click distribution.
<p/>

<h3>Design</h3>
One of the overriding design principles with Click is to keep it simple, this
makes to code easier to understand and more reliable. 
<p/>
Another guiding principle is YAGNI (You Ain't Going to Need It), or don't build 
it until you really really need it. Click is trying to provide an 80/20 rule framework 
where 80% of peoples needs are meet by a framework which is only 20% in size.
<p/>
When developing Click Extras contributions please follow these principles.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

Components and controls should have minimal dependencies. This is to support easy 
deployment of the click-examples and keeps the click build process simple. 
Current available dependencies include:
