<h1>Upgrade Path</h1>

This section discusses the changes you will need to make when upgrading from
one Click version to the next. Please note while the upmost effort is made to ensure
there is no impact between releases, some architectural changes will require
you to modify existing applications to upgrade to a newer version.
<p/>
If you experience any unexpected and undocumented impacts when upgrading between
versions please email the Click user group.

<h2>Version Upgrades</h2>

              DateField, CheckList, and ColorPicker were refactored to package org.apache.click.extras.prototypejs and
              to the JAR file click-extras-prototypejs-xxx.jar. You'll need to update your imports and also your project
              dependency if those 3 controls were used in your project.

      <li class="change"><a name="deprecated-stateful-pages"></a>
          Deprecated stateful page support: <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Page.html#setStateful(boolean)">Page.setStateful()</a>.
          <p/>
          Stateful pages had the following issues:
          <ul>
            <li>
            Stateful pages was introduced to make it easier to store page state across
            multiple HTTP requests. However developing a stateful page is very different
            from developing a stateless one and this lead to Click applications that are
            inconsistent and harder to maintain.
            </li>
            <li>
            In addition stateful page support has never been implemented consistently
            across the framework and some components did not work correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
            Stateful pages are very coarse grained, making it difficult to control
            which objects are stored in the session.
            </li>
            <li>
            Stateful pages have also introduced unnecessary complexity in the framework
            itself, which can now be phased out.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Unfortunately there is no direct upgrade path from a stateful page.
          However the majority of use cases are catered for by the new stateful
          controls: Table, Form, TabbedPanel, Field and AbstractLink.
      </li>
      <li class="change"><a name="removed-bypass-validation"></a>
          The <tt>bypass validation</tt> feature introduced in 2.2.0 raised security
           concerns and was removed in this release.
        <p/>
        The main problem was with <tt>bypassValidation</tt> is that
        an attacker can set the <tt>bypassValidation</tt> hidden field to true, thus bypassing
        validation on the server. In addition , Form.isValid returned <tt>true</tt>
        even when validation was bypassed.
        <p/>
        If you are currently using <tt>bypassValidation</tt> for dynamic forms,
        you can bypass form validation by setting <tt>Form.setValidate(false)</tt>,
        for example:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
public void onInit() {
        super.onInit();

        form.add(nameField);
        form.add(checkbox);

        // NB: when using form.submit() the submit button cannot be
        // called 'submit'. If it is, the browser is likely to throw a JS exception.
        checkbox.setAttribute("onclick", "form.submit()");

        ...

        // NB: Bind the submit button. If it wasn't clicked it means the Form was submitted
        // using JavaScript and we don't want to validate yet
        ClickUtils.bind(submit);

        // If submit was not clicked, don't validate
        if(form.isFormSubmission() && !submit.isClicked()) {
            form.setValidate(false);
        }

        submit.setActionListener(new ActionListener() {

            public boolean onAction(Control source) {
                // We can safely call isValid from within the submit action handler
                // since validation is always active if the submit button was clicked
                if (form.isValid()) {
                addModel("msg", "Form is valid after validation");
            }
                return true;
            }
        });
    } </pre>
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        Control IDs now render underscores instead of periods. If you targeted
        Controls through CSS or JavaScript where the ID had a period, you need
        to change to underscores.
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        The DateField control now accepts month and day names spelled in the 
        locale of the browser or application (see 
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Context.html#getLocale()">Context.getLocale()</a>).
        In previous version a few locales used localized spelling of month and 
        week days names and the remaining locales used English names.  
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="2.2.0"></a>
  <div class="release-header">Version 2.2.0 Upgrade</div></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul style="padding: 0em; margin-left:0em;margin-bottom: 2em">
      <li class="change"><a name="migrate-imports"></a>
        Migrated Click Controls from the old string based
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#getHtmlImports()">HTML imports</a>
        to the new <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/element/Element.html">Element</a>
        based <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#getHeadElements()">HEAD elements</a>.
        <p/>
        Unfortunately this change can lead to runtime behavioral errors for
        applications using the string based <tt>getHtmlImports</tt> approach.
        <p/>
        As runtime errors are often more expensive to fix than compile time errors,
        we have decided to remove the <tt>getHtmlImports</tt> method from the
        Page and Control classes. In addition we have set <tt>getHtmlImports</tt>
        to <tt>final</tt> in Page and Control. This ensures existing codebases
        don't accidentally override this method in custom controls and pages.
        In a future release of Click these final methods will be removed as well.
        <p/>
        This means Click 2.2.0 will force you to migrate from <tt>getHtmlImports</tt>
        to <tt>getHeadElements</tt>.
        <p/>
        Here is a typical example of converting a <tt>getHtmlImports</tt> method
        to <tt>getHeadElements</tt>.
        <p/>
        Before:

        <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyPage extends BorderPage {
     protected static final String HTML_IMPORT =
         "&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" src=\"{0}/js/mylib.css\"/&gt;\n"
         + "&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"{0}/js/mylib.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n"
         + "&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;alert('Hello World!');&lt;/script&gt;\n";

     public String getHtmlImports() {
         String[] args = { getContext().getRequest().getContextPath() };
         return MessageFormat.format(HTML_IMPORTS, args);
     }
}
</pre>

        After:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyPage extends BorderPage {

    public List getHeadElements() {
        // Cater for stateful pages. If you don't use stateful pages you don't need this check
        if (headElements == null) {
            headElements = super.getHeadElements();
            headElements.add(new CssImport("/js/mylib.css"));
            headElements.add(new JsImport("/js/mylib.js"));

            JsScript script = new JsScript();
            script.setContent("alert('Hello World!');");
            headElements.add(script);
        }
        return headElements;
    }
}
</pre>
      </li>
      <li class="change">
      	  Field disabled behavior has changed slightly. In previous versions,
          disabled fields were processed and validated which isn't the desired
          behavior since HTML form POSTs do not submit disabled fields values.
          In addition Form copied disabled field values to domain objects.
          <p/>
          Starting from Click 2.2.0 the disabled behavior has changed as follows:
          <ul>
              <li>
                  Disabled fields are not processed or validated
              </li>
              <li>
                  Disabled field values are not copied to domain objects
              </li>
              <li>
                  Disabled fields are automatically enabled if the field has an
                  incoming request parameter, indicating that the field was enabled
                  on the client using JavaScript. Please note that this behavior does
                  not apply to Checkbox or Radio fields. See the
                  <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/Field.html#setDisabled(boolean)">setDisabled()</a>
                  javadoc for details.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        In previous releases, the default autobinding mode (<tt>public</tt>)
        binded only public Page fields. In 2.2.0 the default autobinding mode
        has been replaced with a new <tt>default</tt> mode which binds both
        public fields and fields annotated with the @Bindable annotation.
        <p/>
        Please note, for backward compatibility the autobinding attribute still
        accepts the <tt>public</tt> value.
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        Added new method <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/Container.html#replace(org.apache.click.control Control, org.apache.click.control Control)">Container.replace</a>
        for replacing an existing control with a new control. AbstractContainer
        has an implementation of this method which should cater for most use cases.
        <p/>
        If however you have custom controls that override the
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/Container.html#insert(org.apache.click.Control, int)">insert</a> or
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/Container.html#add(org.apache.click.Control)">add</a>
        methods, you need to ensure that
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/Container.html#replace(org.apache.click.Control, org.apache.click.Control)">replace</a>
        will function correctly for your control.
        <p/>
        For example, if a custom insert method adds the control to an
        internal list the <tt>replace</tt> method must be overridden to replace
        the control on that list as well.

          Click automatically deploy resources from JARs and folders on the
          classpath that are located under a predefined directory. In previous
          versions of Click that directory was <tt>META-INF/web</tt>.
          <p/>
          The new Servlet 3.0 specification introduced a similar concept where
          resources can be packaged in a JAR and served directly without having
          to be deployed. The directory defined by Servlet 3.0 is
          <tt>META-INF/resources</tt>.
          <p/>
          Click 2.1.0 aligns with Servlet 3.0 in that resources are also deployed
          from <tt>META-INF/resources</tt>.
          <p/>
          For backwards compatibility Click will still deploy resources from
          <tt>META-INF/web</tt>, however it is highly recommended to deploy
          resources from <tt>META-INF/resources</tt> instead.

          JSCalendar which is licensed under LGPL is incompatible with Apache license
          and had to be removed. DateField was refactored accordingly and does
          not contain any Calendar specific code.
          <p/>

          <p/>
          Since the calendar popup is not available to help users pick dates, it
          becomes difficult for users to know the format of the Date.
          To remedy this situation, Click 2.0.1 introduces a new resource key,
          <tt>date-title</tt>, which is set as the title of DateField. The new
          property provides users with visual feedback of the <tt>date format</tt>
          specified on the DateField. For those building i18n applications remember to add this property
          to <span style="color:navy;">DateField_&lt;lang&gt;.properties.</span>
          You can also send us patches for your languages and we will
          include it in the distribution.

          A new project called <a target="blank" class="external" href="http://code.google.com/p/click-calendar/">Click Calendar</a>
          was created as a port of the old DateField functionality. This project
          contains a CalendarField which can be used as a replacement for the
          old DateField.
          <p/>
          For example to have the popup Calendar functionality replace this:
          <pre class="prettyprint">
import org.apache.click.extras.control.DateField;

...

DateField dateField = new DateField("date");
</pre>

          with this:
          <pre class="prettyprint">
import net.sf.click.extras.control.CalendarField;

...

DateField dateField = new CalendarField("date");
</pre>
          CalendarField subclasses DateField so the above snippet is valid.

          project (LGPL) and was replaced by the <a target="blank" class="external" href="">YUI editor</a>
          (BSD license), which is compatible with the Apache license.

    <ul style="padding: 0em; margin-left:0em;">
      <li class="upgrade">
       <b>Please Note</b> Click version 1.5 is <b>not</b> binary compatible with version 1.4. To upgrade your
       applications to use version Click 1.5 you will need to:
       <ol style="margin-top:1em;">
        <li>Recompile your application with the 1.5 Click libraries.</li>
        <li>Retrofit the new Control 
        <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#render(org.apache.click.util.HtmlStringBuffer)">render()</a>
        method to any on your custom control rendering.</li>
        <li>Replace any Control <tt>toString()</tt> methods with an equivalent <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#render(org.apache.click.util.HtmlStringBuffer)">render()</a>
        method. For further details see the example below.</li>
        <li>Form.add(Field), FieldSet.add(Field) and Table.addColumn(Column) now return
        their argument instead of void, which enables you to chain calls for example<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
  table.add(new Column("name")).setSortable(true);
  form.add(new TextField("firstname")).setValue("Bob"); </pre>
        If you created a custom Form, FieldSet or Table and overrode the <em>add</em>
        or <em>addColumn</em> method, you will be forced to return the methods argument.
        For example if you had:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyTable {
    public void addColumn(Column column) {
      ...
    }
} </pre>
       you will need to update as follows:
       <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyTable {
    public Column addColumn(Column column) {
      ...
      // You must return the column
      return column;
    }
} </pre>
        </li>
       </ol>
       Note that Click 1.5 is still compatible with Java JDK 1.4 or later.
      </li>
      <li class="upgrade">
       Deprecated methods: <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#setListener(java.lang.Object, java.lang.String)">Control.setListener(Object, String)</a> and
       <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#getContext()">Control.getContext()</a>.
       These methods have been deprecated on the Control interface as they are not required for ClickServlet -> Control API. 
       This refactoring is part of making the Control interface as small as possible, 
       which  allows more flexibility in future releases.
       <p/>
       Note these methods are still available on <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/AbstractControl.html">AbstractControl</a>,
       so this change should have minimal impact on existing code bases.
      </li>
      <li class="upgrade">
       Upgrade custom Control rendering code to use new 
       <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#render(org.apache.click.util.HtmlStringBuffer)">render</a>
       method. This method allows improved rendering performance, because all controls can be
       rendered from a single buffer that is created when rendering starts.
       <p/>
       If your created custom controls override <em>toString()</em>, please adapt it to the following pattern. From this:
       <pre class="prettyprint">
public class HtmlTable extends AbstractControl {
    ...

    public String toString() {
        int estimatedControlSize = 1000;
        HtmlStringBuffer buffer = new HtmlStringBuffer(estimatedControlSize);

        // Rendering Start
        buffer.elementStart(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000099">"table"</span>);
        appendAttributes(buffer);
        buffer.elementClose();
    
        renderRows(buffer);

        buffer.closeElement(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000099">"table"</span>);
        // Rendering End
     
        return buffer.toString();
    } 
} </pre>
       to this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class HtmlTable extends AbstractControl {
    ...

    public void render(HtmlStringBuffer buffer) {
        // Rendering Start
        buffer.elementStart(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000099">"table"</span>);
        appendAttributes(buffer);
        buffer.elementClose();
    
        renderRows(buffer);

        buffer.closeElement(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000099">"table"</span>);
        <span style="color:green">// Rendering End</span>
    }

    public String toString() {
        int estimatedControlSize = 1000;
        HtmlStringBuffer buffer = new HtmlStringBuffer(estimatedControlSize);
        render(buffer);
        return buffer.toString();
    } 
} </pre>
       Note, the code between the commented section, was moved from <em>toString</em> to the <em>render</em> method.
       <p/>
       Also note that invoking a Control's <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/control/AbstractControl.html#toString()">toString()</a>
       method still outputs the same HTML representation, as toString() delegates to the
       <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/Control.html#render(org.apache.click.util.HtmlStringBuffer)">render</a>
       method.
       <p/>
       <b>Please note</b> a common problem when overriding <em>render</em> in custom components, is
       invoking <em>super.toString()</em> in order to render the Control's default
       markup:
       <pre class="prettyprint">
public class CustomField extends Field {
    ...

    public void render(HtmlStringBuffer buffer) {
        <span style="background:#F3FF0F">String field = super.toString();</span> // BEWARE this line will cause StackOverflowError
        ...
    }

    public String toString() {
        HtmlStringBuffer buffer = new HtmlStringBuffer();
        render(buffer);
        return buffer.toString();
    }
} </pre>
      The highlighted line above will cause a StackOverflowError, meaning an infinite
      loop was encountered. The reason for the error will become obvious when 
      tracing the sequence of calls:
      <ol style="margin-top: 2em;;margin-bottom: 2em">
          <li>The first statement in the method <em>CustomField.render</em> invokes
              <em>super.toString</em>. In this example the super class is Field, thus
              the actual method invoked is <em>Field.toString</em></li>
          <li><em>Field.toString</em> performs its own rendering by invoking <em>Field.render</em>.
            However since CustomField overrides <em>Field.render</em>, <em>Field.toString</em>
            will invoke <em>CustomField.render</em> instead.</li>
          <li>This leads us back to step 1. where <em>CustomField.render</em> invokes
              <em>super.toString</em>. This creates the infinite loop and leads to the StackOverflowError.</li>
      </ol>
      <p/>
      The fix is straight forward. If you override a Control's <em>render</em>
      method, but still want to render the Control's default markup, invoke
      <em>super.render</em> instead of <em>super.toString</em>.
      Here is the correct version:
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public class CustomField extends Field {
    ...

    public void render(HtmlStringBuffer buffer) {
        <span style="background:#F3FF0F">super.render(buffer);</span> // NOTE StackOverflowError won't occur
        ...
    }

    public String toString() {
        HtmlStringBuffer buffer = new HtmlStringBuffer();
        render(buffer);
        return buffer.toString();
    }
} </pre>
      </li>
      <li class="upgrade">
       Certain controls were retrofitted as containers. These include

       Click 1.5 introduces two new properties: <span style="color:navy;">file-size-limit-exceeded-error</span>
       and <span style="color:navy;">post-size-limit-exceeded-error</span>.
       For those building i18n applications remember to add these two properties
       to your <span style="color:navy;">click-control_&lt;lang&gt;.properties.</span>
       <br>If you send us patches for your preferred language we will include them in the distribution.
      </li>
      <li class="upgrade">
       ClickLogger has been replaced with <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/service/LogService.html">LogService</a>.
       LogService is an interface with a default implementation <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/service/ConsoleLogService.html">ConsoleLogService</a>.
       There are also alternative implementations <a href="extras-api/org/apache/click/extras/service/Log4JLogService.html">Log4JLogService</a>
       and <a href="extras-api/org/apache/click/extras/service/JdkLogService.html">JdkLogService</a>.
       <p/>
       It is possible to write your own LogService instance or extend from
       an existing implementation. To setup Click to use an alternative instance you have to
       specify the LogService implementation in <em>click.xml</em>:
       <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;click-app charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;pages package="org.apache.click.examples.page"/&gt;
    &lt;log-service classname="org.apache.click.extras.service.JdkLogService"/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt; </pre>
       <p/>
       While it is generally not recommended to use the Click LogService in your application code, you can retrieve it using the ClickUtils method
       <a href="click-api/org/apache/click/util/ClickUtils.html#getLogService()">getLogService()</a>.
