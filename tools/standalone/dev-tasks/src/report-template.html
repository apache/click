        <h3>Apache Click - Resource Deployment Report</h3>

        This report shows the JavaScript, CSS, images and other resources found
        under the folder "<tt>{0}</tt>" that was deployed to the target folder
        "<tt>{1}</tt>".

        <p/>

        The following JARs and folders contains deployable resources
        (deployable resources are found in JARs and folders under <tt>WEB-INF/web</tt>):

        <ul>
            {2}
        </ul>

        Resources can have one of three states:

        <ul>
            <li>Deployed - the resource was deployed from the JAR to the target folder</li>
            <li>Outdated <span style="color:red">*</span> - the resource was already
                deployed, but a newer version of the resource is available</li>
            <li>Current - the resource was already deployed, no redeploy was necessary.
                Please note, this state is not shown in the detailed report as it is redundent information</li>
        </ul>

        <span style="color:red">*</span> Outdated resources must be
        manually redeployed by either deleting the existing resource and executing
        the deploy task again, or if the existing resource was customized, it must
        be merged by your IDE diff utility.

        <p/>

        Below is the detailed report for the resources that was <tt>Deployed Successfully
        </tt> or <tt>Outdated</tt>.
