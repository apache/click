        <h1>Creating a Release for Subprojects</h1>

        This page documents the requirements for releasing a Click subproject.

        <p/>
        <b>Please note</b> this section is for committers only.

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        Subprojects have the same prerequisites as Click. See <a href="releasing.html#prerequisites">here</a> for details.

        <h3>Release Procedure</h3>

        Subproject releases should adhere to the following steps:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Create the distribution using your favorite build tool e.g. Ant.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create MD5 and SHA1 hashes of the distribution file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Digitally sign the distribution, for example:
                <pre class="codeConfig">gpg --armor --output ClickIDE-X.X.X-incubating.zip.asc --detach-sig ClickIDE-X.X.X-incubating.zip</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Upload the distribution to your account at <tt>people.apache.org</tt>
                under the folder <tt>~/public_html/release/X.X.X</tt>, where X.X.X
                is the version number of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Verify the digital signatures at <tt>people.apache.org</tt> to
                ensure nothing went wrong with the upload.
                <p/>
                Please note if this is the first time you verify your key
                at <tt>people.apache.org</tt>, you'll need to import your public
                key first.
                <p/>
                Assuming your public key ID is '709F7561' and your key is available
                from the public key server 'pgp.mit.edu', the following command
                will import the key on <tt>people.apache.org</tt>:
                <pre class="codeConfig">
ssh people.apache.org
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 709F7561
</pre>
                Next verify the signature with the following command:
                <pre class="codeConfig">
ssh people.apache.org
cd ~/public_html/release/X.X.X
gpg --verify ClickIDE-X.X.X-incubating.zip.asc ClickIDE-X.X.X-incubating.zip
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Releases must be voted on before they are published. Please
                see the <a href="releasing.html#voting">Voting</a>
                section for details.
            </li>
            <li>
                Incubating releases are published at <tt>people.apache.org</tt> under
                the folder:
                <p/>
                <tt>/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/click/<tt>SUBPROJECT</tt>/X.X.X</tt>

                <p/>
                <tt>SUBPROJECT</tt> should be replaced with the name of the subproject.
                For example <tt>ClickIDE</tt> will be published to the folder:

                <p/>
                <tt>/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/click/clickide/X.X.X</tt>

                <p/>
                An easy way to do this is to copy the files in your <tt>public_html</tt>
                folder for example:
                <pre class="codeConfig">ssh people.apache.org
cp ~/public_html/release/X.X.X/* /www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/click/clickide/X.X.X
</pre>
            </li>
             <li>
                Email release announcement to <tt>click-user</tt> and <tt>click-dev</tt>
                mailing lists.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p/>
