<hr/>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0em;">Disclaimer</h3>

<p><em>Apache Click</em> is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache
Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation
is  required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.

        We are exited to announce that Click has been accepted to undergo incubation
