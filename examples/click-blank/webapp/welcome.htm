  <p/>
  Following the <span>struts-blank.war</span> web app starter concept.
  <p/>
  To get started with your own Click application, copy the click-blank.war to a new
  WAR file using the name for your application. 
  <p/>
  Place it in your container's "webapp" folder (or equivalent), and let your container 
  auto-deploy the application. 
  <p/>
  Edit the skeleton configuration files as needed, restart your container, 
  and you are on your way!
