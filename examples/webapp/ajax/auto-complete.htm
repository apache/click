<p>
This AJAX example uses the <tt>AutoCompleteTextField</tt> control.
</p>

${form}

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The <tt>AutoCompleteTextField</tt> control uses the 'Script.aculo.us' <tt>Ajax.Autocompleter</tt> 
class to make an AJAX request when the users a character value. The page's <tt>AutoCompleteTextField</tt>
control handles this AJAX request and returns the list of suggested String values to render.

<pre class="codeJava">
AutoCompleteTextField postCodeField = <span class="kw">new</span> AutoCompleteTextField(<span class="st">"postCode"</span>) {
    <span class="kw">public</span> List getAutoCompleteList(String criteria) {
        <span class="kw">return</span> getPostCodeService().getPostCodeLocations(criteria);
    }
};
postCodeField.setSize(40);  </pre>
