Demonstrates how to <a href="http://api.jquery.com/html/" class="external" target="_blank">update</a>
a table through Ajax requests. This example uses an Ajax
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/" target="_blank" class="external">GET</a>
request to <tt>sort</tt>, <tt>page</tt>, <tt>edit</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> customers.
(The <tt>edit</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> functionality is not fully implemented though)
<p/>
See the <a href="$context/source-viewer.htm?filename=/ajax/table/table-ajax.js" target="_blank" class="external">table-ajax.js</a>
script for details.

<!--
Note: the table is wrapped in a div, allowing us to easily replace both the table and its paginator
from the server response

<div id="tableContainer">
$table
</div>

<div id="result">
