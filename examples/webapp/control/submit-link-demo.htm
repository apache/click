This page demonstrates some usage patterns of the SubmitLink control.

<h3>Demo1</h3>

In this first demo is shown how the Form is submitted when the SubmitLink is
clicked.

$demo1

#if ($demo1Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo1Msg</p>
#end

<h3>Demo2</h3>

In this second demo is shown how the SubmitLink's parameters are
submitted together with the Form.

$demo2

#if ($demo2Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo2Msg</p>
#end

<h3>Demo3</h3>

This demo shows how the SubmitLink can be used outside of a Form. When a SubmitLink
is not inside a Form it behaves like a normal ActionLink.

<p/>

Click $standaloneLink to demonstrate.

#if ($demo3Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo3Msg</p>
#end

<h3>Demo4</h3>

<script type="text/javascript">
    function confirmSubmit(link, formName, msg) {
        var confirm = window.confirm(msg);
        if (confirm) {
            return Click.submitLinkAction(link, formName);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</script>

This demo shows how a confirmation message can be displayed before the
SubmitLink submits the Form.

<p/>

$demo4

#if ($demo4Msg)
<p class="infoMsg"> $demo4Msg</p>
#end
