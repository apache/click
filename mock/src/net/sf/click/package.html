Provides a mock package for Click, enabling unit testing of Pages and Controls.
<p/>
This package defines the main mock classes but developers only have to be concerned
with two classes namely {@link net.sf.click.MockContainer} and
{@link net.sf.click.MockContext}.
<p/>
The main class developers will use is {@link net.sf.click.MockContainer} which
provides mocking mocking of application pages and controls.
<p/>
The other class is {@link net.sf.click.MockContext} which only provides mocking
of a {@link net.sf.click.Control} but is much easier to setup and use than
{@link net.sf.click.MockContainer}.
