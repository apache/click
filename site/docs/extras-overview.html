Click Extras provides a library of additional controls and components which are outside
of the core Click framework. 
</p>
<p>
Click Extras are packaged as a separated JAR which 
you can deploy with your application. Extra packages include:
<ul style="margin-top:0.75em;">
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/cayenne/package-summary.html">Cayenne</a> 
 - provides Cayenne data aware controls</li>
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/control/package-summary.html">Control</a> 
 - provides extra controls</li>
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/filter/package-summary.html">Filter</a> 
 - provides GZIP compression Filter</li>
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/hibernate/package-summary.html">Hibernate</a>
 - provides Hibernate data aware controls</li>
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/panel/package-summary.html">Panel</a> 
 - provides Page Panel containers</li>
 <li><a href="org/apache/click/extras/spring/package-summary.html">Spring</a> 
 - provides Spring integration SpringClickServlet</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p/>
Please Note the Cayenne, Hibernate and Spring dependencies are only required if you use these particular features.
For example if you are using Hibernate for your persistence framework, the
<a href="../extras-api/org/apache/click/extras/cayenne/CayenneForm.html">CayenneForm</a>
control will not cause any issues as this class would never be loaded by your application.

<p/>
For a detailed list of dependencies please see <a href="building.html#extras-dependencies">Extras Dependencies</a>.
