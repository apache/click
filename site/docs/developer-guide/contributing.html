        <h3>Click Extras</h3>
        Click Extras provides a place for people to contribute their own code to the
        Click project and have it package with the standard distribution. Contributed
        code will be subject to review and may require modifications before it is
        included in the Click distribution.
        <p/>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        One of the overriding design principles with Click is to keep it simple, this
        makes the code easier to understand and more reliable.
        <p/>
        Another guiding principle is YAGNI (You Ain't Going to Need It), or don't build
        it until you really really need it. Click is trying to provide an 80/20 rule framework
        where 80% of peoples needs are meet by a framework which is only 20% in size.
        <p/>
        When developing Click Extras contributions please follow these principles.

        <h3>Auto File Deployment</h3>
        To make preconfigured resources (templates, stylesheets, etc.) available to web applications
        Click automatically deploys configured classpath resources to the <tt class="blue">/click</tt>
        directory at startup (existing files will not be overwritten).
        <p/>
        To enable your controls to deploy resources on startup place the resources
        in the Click Extras JAR directory 'META-INF/resources/'. See the section
        <a href="../user-guide/html/ch04s03.html#deploying-custom-resources">Deploying Custom Resources</a>
        for more information on resource deployment.

        <h3>Coding Style and Practices</h3>

        Click follows the Sun conversions for Java code style. Other style conventions
        and practices include:
        <ul style="margin-top:0.75em;margin-bottom:0.75em;">
            <li>indents are 4 spaces wide and no tabs are used</li>
            <li>public and protected visibility members require Javadoc</li>
            <li>private and package visibility members do not require Javadoc</li>
            <li>favour the use of unchecked <tt>RuntimeException</tt> and avoid creating new Exception classes</li>
            <li>check method parameters and throw <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> if parameters are null or invalid</li>
            <li>avoid creating any more classes than you need to get the job done</li>
            <li>localize control messages in the classes <tt>properties</tt> files</li>
            <li>use the <tt>Context.getLocale()</tt> method to obtain a users locale</li>
            <li>before checking in code run the Ant task: <tt>ant format-java</tt>
        </ul>
