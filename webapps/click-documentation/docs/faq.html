  <dt><b>Why develop a new Web Application Framework?</b></dt>
  <dd>
  Because the existing frameworks did not meet my needs. Struts doesn't really do much, 
  while Tapestry is too complicated. 
  <p/>

  <dt><b>How can the GUI designer define the HTML if Click Controls generates everything?</b></dt>
  <dd>
  In Click there is nothing preventing you from laying out HTML forms by hand. 
  It just provides the option of doing it automatically for you.
  <p/>
  There are a number of approaches you can use for generating for HTML,
  each with pros &amp; cons:
  <p/>
  <ol>
  <li>
  <u>Use Click forms and controls to do all the HTML rendering for you.</u> 
  <p/>
  This a 80/20 approach where you can quickly get stuff developed, but it may
  not meet all your UI style requirements. 
  <p/>
  Please note the Forms control provides many 
  <a href="click-api/net/sf/click/control/Form.html#auto-layout">auto layout</a> 
  options, see the <a href="examples.html">click-examples</a> 'Form Properties' 
  for a demonstration.
  <p/>
  </li><li>
  <u>Subclass Click Form/Controls to customise HTML rendering.</u> 
  <p/>
  This is a good approach for ensuring a common LAF across your web application, 
  but you will have to get your hands dirty and write some code.
  </li><li>
  <u>Use Velocity macros for a generic HTML layout.</u>
  <p/>
  This is easy to do and gives you good reuse across your web application.
  <p/>
  Please see the Form 
  <a href="click-api/net/sf/click/control/Form.html#velocity-macros">velocity macros</a> 
  example, and also see the <a href="examples.html">click-examples</a> 'Velocity Macro' 
  demonstration. 
  </li><li>
  <u>Layout your HTML forms by hand.</u> 
  <p/>
  This gives you the ultimate control in presentation, but provides no reuse 
  across your web application. 
  <p/>
  Please see the Form
  <a href="click-api/net/sf/click/control/Form.html#manual-layout">manual layout</a>
  example.
  </li>
  </ol>

  <a name="localization" class="heading"></a>
  <dt><b>How do you internationalize Pages and Control labels?</b></dt>
  <dd>
   Click provides good string localization support for internationalization requirements.
   <p/>
   The Page class supports page specific string localisation bundles using the 
   method 
   <a href="click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html#getMessage(java.lang.String)">getMessage(String)</a>.
   For example a Login class with three locale string property files on the classpath:
<pre class="codeConfig">
/com/mycorp/pages/Login.properties
/com/mycorp/pages/Login_en.properties
/com/mycorp/pages/Login_fr.properties </pre>
  
   The Field control classes share a common string properties file:
<pre class="codeConfig">
/click-control.properties </pre>  

   The field class provides a number of 
   <a href="click-api/net/sf/click/control/Field.html#getMessage(java.lang.String)">getMessage(String)</a>
   methods which support localized strings and message formatting.
   Please also see the Control topic <a href="controls.html#message-properties">Message Properties</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <a name="why-velocity" class="heading"></a>
  <dt><b>Why not use FreeMarker instead of Velocity?</b></dt>
  <dd>
   FreeMarker was evaluated against Velocity for template rendering,
   and has some features Velocity doesn't. However Velocity was
   chosen over FreeMaker because it doesn't use an XML based 
   syntax, so its easier to read, and because Velocity is easier
   to learn.
   <p/>
   One of FreeMarker's strong points compared to Velocity is error reporting.
   This issue is addressed in Click by using a custom Velocity 1.5 build 
   to provided enhanced error reporting.
   <p/>
   Its actually better than the line-precise error reporting you get in
   Tapesty, as Click will render the source code with the error. For
   example:
   <ul>
      <li><a href="error-parsing.html">Page Parsing Error</a></li>
      <li><a href="error-npe.html">Null Pointer Error</a></li>
   </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <a name="spring-integration" class="heading"></a>
  <dt><b>How can you integrate Click into Spring?</b></dt>
  <dd>
   The Spring non-web components can be readily used in Click as they can with any framework.
   <p/>
   The Spring Web MVC Framework however is not compatible with Click. The Spring framework
   uses a low level command pattern design like Struts and WebWork.
   <p/>
   Spring uses a <tt>DispatcherServlet</tt> to route requests to <tt>Controller</tt> 
   objects and then passes the <tt>ModelAndView</tt> results to the rendering layer.

<pre class="codeJava">
public interface Controller {
   public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, 
                                     HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception;
} </pre>

  In Spring the integration plugin points are the Controllers.
  <p/>
  Click uses higher level design constructs focusing on Pages and Controls. Click uses its
  own <tt>ClickServlet</tt> for dispatching requests to <tt>Pages</tt> and <tt>Control</tt>s, 
  which are Clicks plugin points.
