The javadoc folder contains a test for javadoc purposes. The file 'src/build.txt'
contains the snippet that must be part of the 'javadoc' and target.

The prettify*.css and prettify*.js is the external files that must be linked
to a blog so syntax highlighting can work. The file 'src/blog-test.html' is a 
test which links prettify*.css and prettify*.js to show how it works.

To activate prettify the window.onload event must call the 'prettyPrint()'
function.

Once active the all <pre class="prettyprint"> tags will be highlighted. In blogs
rather use <pre class="prettyprint" style="overflow:auto"> so that a scrollbar
appear when sentences becomes very long.
